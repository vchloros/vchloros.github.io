## About Me

<br/>

As a BS Biology student in my senior year, I'm gaining new experience in using R & RStudio for statistics and applying that knowledge to biology. In maintaining two repositories for my courses, I created a landing page to help display my work. 
I have examples of the work I've done for each of my courses here on GitHub: [Intro to Bioinformatics](https://vchloros.github.io/BIO422/PalmerPenguins_Initial.html) and [Statistical Learning & Classification](https://vchloros.github.io/MAT434/1stDoc.html).

## Current Projects

### Friends with Phylogeny: Approachable Software and Methodologies for Undergraduates Making Phylogenetic Trees

Bioinformatics has been and continues to cement itself as key pillar of biology as a whole. Despite that fact, many undergrads aren't exposed to fundamental skills and concepts that will become vital, both in furthering education and in future careers. As someone who is primarily interested in evolutionary biology, I found that building phylogenetic trees was a good early introduction into incorporating knowledge of statistics and computer science into my studies. However, there are a large variety of software and methods available for students intereseted in making trees, so starting out can be intimidating. As my senior year capstone at SNHU, I want to test different freely available phylogenetic tree making software and rate them based on how easy they are to use from an undergraduate perspective and how reliable the resulting trees are when compared to an widely-accepted reference tree.
